### How the Loyalty Program Works

We classify every customer into one of three tiers based on their purchasing history over the last 5 years (2020–2024). A customer earns **Loyal** status by meeting **all three** of the following criteria:

1. **Tenure** — They've been a customer for at least **4 years**
2. **Consistency** — They've made purchases in at least **3 of the last 5 years** (60%). This allows for up to 2 "off" years, so we don't penalize a good customer for one bad year.
3. **Revenue** — They've generated at least **$35,000 in total revenue** over the 5-year window

Customers with 4+ years tenure who don't meet the consistency or revenue bar are classified as **Not Qualified**. Customers with fewer than 4 years are **Ineligible** — they simply haven't been with us long enough to evaluate yet.

### High-Level Results

| Status | Customers | % of Base | 5-Year Revenue | % of Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Loyal** | 1,691 | 9.1% | $276.4M | **69.8%** |
| Not Qualified | 5,530 | 29.9% | $49.9M | 12.6% |
| Ineligible | 11,277 | 61.0% | $69.7M | 17.6% |

**The key takeaway:** Just 9% of our customer base drives nearly 70% of our revenue. These are the customers we need to protect.

The average Loyal customer generates **$163,445** over 5 years — roughly **26x more** than the average non-loyal customer ($6,184 for Ineligible, $9,018 for Not Qualified).

### Why Customers Don't Qualify

Of the 5,530 customers with enough tenure but who didn't make the cut:
- **3,096** fell below the $35K revenue threshold (they buy, but not enough)
- **2,431** fell below both revenue and consistency thresholds (sporadic, low-value purchases)
- **3** had the revenue but not enough consistency (very rare)

### Example Loyal Accounts

**Large accounts:**
| Customer | Segment | Tenure | Active Years | 5-Year Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wayfair, LLC | Marketplace | 5 yr | 5 of 5 | $28.5M |
| Overstock.Com | Marketplace | 5 yr | 5 of 5 | $10.9M |
| Home Goods | National Retail | 4 yr | 5 of 5 | $10.1M |

**Typical loyal accounts** (near the $70K median):
These are the core of the program — mid-size accounts that consistently buy year after year and represent our reliable revenue base.

### Bottom Line

This framework gives us a data-driven way to identify and protect the customers who matter most. Protecting 1,691 accounts preserves $276M in revenue. The thresholds are intentionally designed to be forgiving — a customer can have up to 2 weak years and still qualify — so we're rewarding genuine long-term relationships, not penalizing temporary dips.
